# my heart will go on

Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you, go on

Far across the distance
And spaces, between us
You have come to show you, go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does, go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on, and on

Love can touch us one time
And last for a life time
And never let go till we're gone

Love was when I loved you
One true time, I hold to
In my life we'll always, go on
